# 🍱 Food-101: Image-Based Food Classification with TensorFlow

This project uses **TensorFlow** and deep learning to classify images of food into one of 101 categories from the popular **Food-101 dataset**. The goal is to train a model that can recognize food items from an image input — making it useful for applications like smart restaurant menus, food logging apps, or nutrition tracking.
